Genotype array data provides measurements at hundreds of thousands of
genetically variable sites. The raw measurements consist of two
intensity signals, one for each allele, which are subsequently
transformed into the log-scaled ratio of the observed and the expected
intensity (LRR), and the B Allele Frequency (BAF) which captures the
relative contribution from one allele (B) to the fluorescent signal. 

In the plots, each dot corresponds to one marker in the fibroblast
(red) or ips (blue) cell line. For example, the homozygous reference
genotypes will be plotted as BAF=0, heterozygous genotypes as BAF=0.5
and homozygous alternate genotypes as BAF=1. Markers which
significantly deviate are indicative of non-diploid copy number state.

The two middle lanes show transitions between copy number states in
black line, with the thick blue/red background of the black line
representing the confidence of the prediction. In red/blue are
emphasized the predicted CN differences between the fibroblast and the
ips line.
