Genotyping array
===============

HipSci assays for genotypes in all candidate iPS cell lines and in the somatic
cells from which they were derived. This assay is used as a quality control
check before cell lines are selected for banking. 

The called genotypes between the somatic cells and the derived iPS cells from
the same donor, are compared to assess genomic integrity in the derived iPSC
lines. Aneuploidy and subchromosomal aberrations are detected from these
genotyping arrays.
