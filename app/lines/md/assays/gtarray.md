Genotyping array
===============

HipSci assays for genotypes in all candidate iPS cell lines, typically two or
three per donor, and in the somatic cell lines from which they were derived
(e.g. fibroblasts). The assay is used as QC before one cell line from each
donor is selected for banking. The assay uses the HumanCoreExome-12 v1 BeadChip
Kit from Illumina.

HipSciâ€™s QC procedure is to compare the called genotypes between the primary
and derived cells of the same donor, to ensure genomic integrity in the derived
lines. Aneuploidy and subchromosomal aberrations are detected from genotyping
arrays by detecting differences in copy number between the original fibroblasts
and iPSCs using a HMM algorithm detected for the purpose.
