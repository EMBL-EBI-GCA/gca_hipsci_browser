Methylation array
================

Methylation profiling by array is used to probe the methylation pattern of DNA, which is a suppressor of gene activity. Methylation is used in HipSci’s assessment of variability in the pluripotent phenotype, and it’s dependence on genetic and techncial factors.

HipSci assays iPS cell lines that are selected for banking after they have passed QC, typically one cell line per donor. The assay uses the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.0
