Cellular phenotyping
===================

The cellular phenotyping project at KCL is evaluating how iPSCs respond to
chemical, physical and biological stimuli. A high-content platform has been
developed using novel assays and artificial stimuli to analyse iPSC behaviour
in different microenvironments. These data contribute to HipSciâ€™s research into
the dependence of phenotypic variance on genetic and epigenetic variance.
