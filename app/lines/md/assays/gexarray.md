Expression array
===============

Transcription profiling by array is used to measure the activity of genes in the HipSci cell lines.

All candidate iPS cell lines are assayed, typically two or three per donor, as well as the somatic cell line from which they were derived (e.g. fibroblasts). The assay is used as QC before one cell line from each donor is selected for banking. The assay uses the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Kit from Illumina.

Gene expression array is used for the pluritest, a bioinformatic assay to assess the pluripotency of iPSC lines based on a training panel of 450 control cell lines.

A key part of HipSci’s research is to assess the dependence of gene expression variation in IPSCs on various cell line variables and on technical variables. HipSci’s extensive data set from the gene expression array allows for great statistical sensivity in assessing these correlations.
