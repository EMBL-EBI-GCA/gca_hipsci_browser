Expression array
===============

Transcription profiling by array is used to measure the activity of genes in the HipSci cell lines. 

All candidate iPS cell lines are assayed alongside the somatic cells from which they were derived. This assay is used as a quality control check before cell lines are selected for banking. 

Gene expression array is used for the pluritest, a bioinformatic assay to assess the pluripotency of iPSC lines based on a training panel of 450 control cell lines.
