Whole exome sequencing
======================

Whole exome sequencing is performed on all iPSC lines selected for banking in order to genotype those lines in the exonic regions of the genome.

Furthermore, we have sequenced ~250 of the somatic cell lines from which the iPSCs were derived.  These somatic cell lines are all from the open-access healthy volunteer cohort.
