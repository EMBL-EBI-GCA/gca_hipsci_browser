HipSci has established a banking arrangement with [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/) for distribution of cell
lines to academic researchers, and have run a training course on using HipSci
cells with ECACC and potential downstream users. We also have an agreement
with [EBiSC](http://www.ebisc.org/) for future distribution to commercial (as well as
academic) researchers

Cells lines are marked with their current 'banked status'

* **Banked at ECACC:** Cell lines that are available from the [European Collection of Cell Cultures](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp)
* **Banked at EBiSC:** Cell lines that are available from the [European Bank for induced pluripotent stem cells](http://www.ebisc.org/)
* **Selected for banking:** Cell lines that have passed HipSci's QC standards, and will continue in the pipeline towards being frozen down and banked at ECACC or EBiSC.
* **Pending selection:** Cell lines yet to undergo QC, or cell lines awaiting a decision on whether they will get banked. Typically, HipSci derives two or three candidate iPS cell lines for each donor, only one of which will be selected for banking.
* **Not selected:** Cell lines which will not ever be available from a bank. Typically, this means another cell line from the same donor has been preferentially selected.
