HipSci has established a banking arrangement with [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/) for distribution of cell
lines to academic researchers, and have run a training course on using HipSci
cells with ECACC and potential downstream users. We also have an agreement
with [EBiSC](http://www.ebisc.org/) for future distribution to commercial (as well as
academic) researchers

Cells lines are marked with their current 'banked status'

* **Banked at ECACC <span class="b-status banked-ecacc">(B)</span>:**
Cell lines that are currently available from the
[European Collection of Cell Cultures](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp)

* **Banked at ECACC and EBiSC <span class="b-status banked-ebisc">(B)</span>:**
Cell lines that are available from the
[European Collection of Cell Cultures](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp)
and [European Bank for induced pluripotent stem cells](http://www.ebisc.org)

* **Selected for banking <span class="b-status bank-selected">(S)</span>**: Cell lines that have passed HipSci's QC standards,
and will continue in the pipeline towards being frozen down and banked at ECACC
or EBiSC.

* **Pending selection (P):** Cell lines yet to undergo QC, or cell lines awaiting a
decision on whether they will be selected or banked. Typically, HipSci strives
to derive two iPS cell lines for each donor, both of which will be selected for
banking at a cell bank, if they pass QC.

* **Not selected (N):** Cell lines that will never be available from a cell bank.
Typically, this means another cell line from the same donor has been
preferentially selected, or the line has failed to pass QC.
