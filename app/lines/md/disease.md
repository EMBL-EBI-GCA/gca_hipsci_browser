The HipSci project is generating iPS cell lines from patients with inherited genetic diseases.
iPSC technology provides opportunity for modelling human disease in the culture dish.

###Bardet-Biedl syndrome

[Bardet-Biedl syndrome](/disease/bardet-biedl) (BBS) is a ciliopathy with multisystem involvement.
University College London contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.

###Maturity onset diabetes of the young

[Maturity onset diabetes of the young](/disease/diabetes) refers to forms of the disease which are
attributable to a mutation in a single gene of the individual.
Exeter Medical School contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.
This cohort represents monogenic forms of disease; the gene responsible could be different
across the different tissue donors.

###Normal

The HipSci collection of cell lines also includes a large number from phenotypically
'normal' donors, with no diagnosed genetic disease.
Cambridge BioResource contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.
