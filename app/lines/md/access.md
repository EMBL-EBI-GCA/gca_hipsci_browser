All cell lines from donors with rare diseases are classed as "managed access".

Cell lines from our normal healthy donors are either "managed access" or "open access" depending on the ethics under which they were collected.

## Managed access 

The recipient of a managed access cell line agrees that:

* Genetic or genomic data it generates from use of the Cell Line will be held securely and only
used in biomedical research
* Genetic or genomic data will only be made available to third party
researchers under a Data Access Agreement at least as stringent as the Data
Access Agreement for data from the same Cell Lines at the EGA submitted by
Sanger.

Sanger encourages submission of genomic data to a managed access
repository such as the [EGA](https://ega-archive.org) or [dbGAP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap),
with access being restricted to use for biomedical research and subject to a
Data Access Agreement at least as stringent as that for data from the same Cell
Lines at the EGA submitted by Sanger.

For the avoidance of doubt, genetic or
genomic data from the Cell Lines may not be made available on the open
internet.


## Open access


The recipient of an open access cell line agrees:

* Not to make any attempt to identify the original donors of the Cell Lines.
* To remove any
data mapping to the Y chromosome (including sequencing reads, genotypes etc.)
before making genetic or genomic data available to third parties.

Once this has been done, data may be made available for biomedical research in an open
access fashion, permitting redistribution of derived data sets.
