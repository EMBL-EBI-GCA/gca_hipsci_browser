Monogenic diabetes
==================

Monogenic diabetes refers to forms of the disease which are attributable to a
mutation in a single gene of the individual. Exeter Medical School contributed
the tissue samples for this cohort to the HipSci project. This cohort
represents any monogenic form of disease; the gene responsible could be
different across the different tissue donors.
