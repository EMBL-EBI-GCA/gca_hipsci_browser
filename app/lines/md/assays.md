HipSci cell lines are assayed with a number of genomic assays throughout the iPSC derivation pipeline.

* Click on the cell line to see assay data available for the line
* Use the [Search Files](#/files) tab to find assay data files by type
* See the [assay pages](/data) for much more information on the assays

###[Expression array](/assay/gexarray)

Transcription profiling by array is used to measure the activity of genes in
the HipSci cell lines.

HipSci assays the transcriptome espression profile in all iPS cell lines and in the
primary tissue cells (e.g. fibroblasts).  HipSci's QC procedure uses transcript
expression to ensure that derived cell lines have a profile typical of the
pluripotent state.

###[Genotyping array](/assay/gtarray)

HipSci assays for genotypes in all iPS cell lines and in the primary
tissue cells from which they were derived (e.g. fibroblasts). HipSci's QC procedure is to
compare the called genotypes between the primary and derived cells of the
same donor, to ensure genomic integrity in the derived lines.

###[Exome sequencing](/assay/exomeseq)

Exome sequencing is performed on all HipSci iPS cell lines selected for banking
after passing QC. Sequencing and primary analysis  are performed at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institue.

###[RNA sequencing](/assay/exomeseq)

RNA-sequencing is performed on all HipSci iPS cell lines selected for banking
after passing QC. Sequencing and primary analysis  are performed at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institue.

###[Methylation array](/assay/mtarray)

Methylation profiling by array is used to probe the methylation pattern of DNA,
which is a suppressor of gene activity.

HipSci assays iPS cell lines that are selected for banking after passed QC.

###[Proteomics](/assay/proteomics)

The proteomics project at Dundee
uses mass spectrometry to assay the proteome of the HipSci cell lines.

###[Cellular phenotyping](/assay/cellbiol-fn)

The cell phenotyping project at KCL aims to discover how genetic variation
contributes to variation in cell behaviour. We thus measure how cells respond
to specific extrinsic stimuli that represent key components of the stem cell
microenvironment (niche) in vivo.

### Whole genome sequencing

A small selection of cell lines have been selected for deep whole genome sequencing by Illumina XTen.
