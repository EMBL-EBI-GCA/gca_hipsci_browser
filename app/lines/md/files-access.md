###Managed access data

The consent agreement of some HipSci donors authorises release of **individually unique data**
only for specific research use to bona fide researchers.
Files on this page are marked as 'Managed access' if they contain individually unique data for donors
that are bound by these restrictions.

Managed access data are stored in the [EGA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega) archive.
For access to
these data, researchers must read the Data Access Agreement documents([pdf](/documents/hipsci-daa.pdf)) and
register for access via WTSI's [Electronic Data Access Mechanism](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/DAA/MasterController).

###Open access data

The consent agreement of some HipSci donors authorises release of **individually unique data**
to all parties, with no requirement to satisfy any data access restrictions.
Files on this page are marked as 'Open access' if there are no restrictions on the donor's individually unique data,
or if the file contains non-unique data only.

###Individually-unique vs Non-unique

Individually unique data are uniquely associated to the cell lineâ€™s donor. In
particular, data comprising genetic information are classed as individually
unique. Examples include genotypes or sequencing data.

Non-unique data are not uniquely linkable to the sample donor. Examples include proteomics mass spectrometry or transcript quantifications from RNA-seq.
