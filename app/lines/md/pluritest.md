The PluriTest is a pluripotency assessment based on DNA microarray data, which
considers the genome-wide expression profile of the sample
([doi:10.1038/nmeth.1580](www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n4/full/nmeth.1580.html)).

PluriTest scores should be assessed in the context of the empirical
distribution of pluripotent and somatic samples used to construct and validate
PluriTest (e.g. [Exemplary use of PluriTest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK133282/figure/assessmentofhumanpluripotent.F6/)).
The training set of iPSC clustered with pluripotency score > 25 and novelty
score < 1.67 with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Cell lines with
pluritest scores > 10 also cluster with the PluriTest training data set with
high sensitivy and specificity.
