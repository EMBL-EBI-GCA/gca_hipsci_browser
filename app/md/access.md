###Managed access data

The consent agreement of some HipSci donors authorises release of [individually unique data](/data/access#unique)
only for specific research use to bona fide researchers.
Cell lines on this page are marked as 'Managed access' if the donor's individually unique data are bound by these restrictions.

Managed access data are stored in the [EGA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega) archive.
For access to
these data, researchers must read the Data Access Agreement documents([pdf](/documents/HipSci_Normals_DAA_v3.2_form.pdf), [doc](/documents/HipSci_Normals_DAA_v3.2_form.doc)) and
register for access via WTSI's [Electronic Data Access Mechanism](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/DAA/MasterController).

###Open access data

The consent agreement of some HipSci donors authorises release of [individually unique data](/data/access#unique)
to all parties, with no requirement to satisfy any data access restrictions.
Cell lines on this page are marked as 'Open access' if there are no restrictions on the donor's individually unique data.

###Individually-unique vs Non-unique

The difference between individually-unique and non-unique data is explained on HipSci's
[data access information page](/data/access/). Managed access restrictions apply only to
individually-unique data types; non-unique data can be distributed openly for any cell line.
